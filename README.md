🚀 Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech
📊 Task 1 Submission: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔍 Introduction
Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 🌍 world_population_dataset, focusing on creating insightful visualizations to understand data distributions.

📂 Dataset Description
The world_population_dataset contains global population data 🌎 from 2001 to 2022, offering insights into population changes across different countries over time.

🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
🐍 Jupyter Notebook

📊 Pandas for data manipulation

➕ NumPy for numerical operations

🎨 Matplotlib & Seaborn for creating visualizations

🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Process
Key steps followed during the EDA process:

🧹 Data Cleaning:

Checked for and handled missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers to ensure a clean dataset.

📈 Data Visualization:

Created various visualizations to uncover patterns in the data, including:

📊 Bar charts to compare population across countries.

🟪 Stacked charts to show distribution trends over time and categories.

✅ Conclusion
This EDA process provided meaningful insights 🌟 into population distributions and trends, laying a strong foundation for deeper data exploration and future machine learning tasks.

🙏 Thank you for reviewing my submission!
