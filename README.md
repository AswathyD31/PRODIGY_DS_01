# **Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech**

## **Task 1 Submission:**

Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 🌍 world_population_dataset, focusing on creating insightful visualizations to understand data distributions.

## Dataset Description
____________
The world_population_dataset contains global population data 🌎 from 2001 to 2022, offering insights into population changes across different countries over time.

## Tools and Libraries Used
__________________
 * Jupyter Notebook

* Pandas for data manipulation

* NumPy for numerical operations

* Matplotlib & Seaborn for creating visualizations

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Process
________________
Key steps followed during the EDA process:

* **Data Cleaning:**

- Checked for and handled missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers to ensure a clean dataset.

 * **Data Visualization:**

- Created various visualizations to uncover patterns in the data, including:

* **Bar charts to compare population across countries.**

- Stacked charts to show distribution trends over time and categories.

## Conclusion
____________
This EDA process provided meaningful insights 🌟 into population distributions and trends, laying a strong foundation for deeper data exploration and future machine learning tasks.

🙏 Thank you for reviewing my submission!
